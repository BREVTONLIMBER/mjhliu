<h3 style="text-align: left; color: green;"><i>Science is a systematic discipline that builds and organises knowledge in the form of testable hypotheses and predictions about the world.[1][2] Modern science is typically divided into two or three major branches:[3] the natural sciences</h3></i>
<h3 style="text-align: right; color: orange;"><u>Logic is the study of correct reasoning. It includes both formal and informal logic. Formal logic is the study of deductively valid inferences or logical truths. It examines how conclusions follow from premises based on the structure of arguments alone, independent of their topic and content.</h3></u>
<h3 style="text-align:left; color: lime;"><b>Logic studies arguments, which consist of a set of premises that leads to a conclusion. An example is the argument from the premises "it's Sunday" and "if it's Sunday then I don't have to work" leading to the conclusion "I don't have to work".[1] Premises and conclusions express propositions or claims that can be true or false. </h3></b>
